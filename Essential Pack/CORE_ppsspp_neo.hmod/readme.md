ADHOC SUPPORT (by Igor Calabria)
================================
This is based on coldbird's code: https://code.google.com/archive/p/aemu/
All credit goes to him!

Status
------
Code is a bit of a mess and it's not fully functional yet, I still need to implement
some functions and add a upnp lib(really important for people with routers).

I did test it with some games(emulator <-> real psp with the server running locally)
and it's looking good:

* Worms Open Warfare: Ran just fine, I was able to play a whole match without problems
* Monster Hunter Freedom Unite: Runs fine too. Gathering Hall and embarking on quests works
* Dissidia Duodecim 012: Doesn't work. It requires some functions that I haven't implemented
yet. Also, it uses a port < 1000 and thats reserved for admin apps on linux, running the emu
as sudo "solves" it, but it's far from ideal.
* Pacman World Rally: Works too.

Update (Kyhel) :
---------------
* Now compiles on both Mac OSX and Windows. For more details on how to play and build
go to see there http://forums.ppsspp.org/showthread.php?tid=3595&pid=59241#pid59241
* Got it tested windows <-> mac osx <-> psp, it works
* Monster Hunter 3rd HD works too, as well as God Eater Burst.
